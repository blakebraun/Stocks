This program mines data contained in a text file filled with stock data. It prompts the user for a filename (Apple stock stored in stocks.txt in my example,) validates the file, and then prompts the user for a year, validating for correctness.  It then prints the opening, closing, high, low, and volume of the stock along with the months that had the highest and lowest values. Running pp5.py will begin program execution.
